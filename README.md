Feel free to use it to work upon/ edit/ fix or make a different theme all together. It's out there.

**- To Do -**
- Find and fix some of the text input bars.
- Other parts which might be missing
- The player passport and clan member intro book/page is still the same.
- Parts which sticks out of the main windows (Market Sell/Buy Stand/ Guid window items
- Further font color fixing to make it more coherent. 
- The level display on hero characters are still not displayed.
